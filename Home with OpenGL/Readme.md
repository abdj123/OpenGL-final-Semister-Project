This code is a simple OpenGL program that draws a grass field using triangles. The grass is made up of multiple triangles that form a patch of grass. The grass patch is then replicated to form a field of grass. The program also allows the user to translate, rotate and scale the field of grass using keyboard input.

### Requirements:

- Windows operating system
- OpenGL library
- GLUT library
#### How to use:
 Compile the code using an OpenGL compiler.
Run the executable file in a console.
The grass field will be displayed on the screen.
Use the following keyboard keys to manipulate the grass field:
'x' and 'X': Rotate the grass field around the x-axis.
'y' and 'Y': Rotate the grass field around the y-axis.
'z' and 'Z': Rotate the grass field around the z-axis.
'u' and 'U': Translate the grass field along the x-axis.
'v' and 'V': Translate the grass field along the y-axis.
'w' and 'W': Translate the grass field along the z-axis.
's' and 'S': Scale the grass field uniformly.
'a' and 'A': Scale the grass field along the x-axis.
'b' and 'B': Scale the grass field along the y-axis.
'c' and 'C': Scale the grass field along the z-axis.
Press 'ESC' to exit the program.
#### Limitations:

The program is only able to draw a static grass field and cannot be used for dynamic animations.
The program does not include error checking for incorrect keyboard inputs or invalid user input.
